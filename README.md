Description:
SimpleBankingSystem is a C++ project developed for the Programming Fundamentals Lab Final Project. 
The objective of this project is to implement a straightforward banking system that enables users to create accounts, deposit money, withdraw money, and display account information.
The project demonstrates the use of basic control structures such as loops and switch-case statements to manage user interactions and account operations.

Features:
Account Creation: Allows users to create new bank accounts with unique account numbers and initial balances.
Deposit Money: Enables users to deposit money into their accounts, updating the account balance accordingly.
Withdraw Money: Allows users to withdraw money from their accounts, ensuring sufficient balance before the transaction.
Display Account Information: Provides users with the ability to view account details including account number, account holder's name, and current balance.
Menu-Driven Interface: Utilizes a user-friendly menu to navigate through different banking operations.
Objective:
Implement a simple banking system in C++ that allows users to:
Create accounts
Deposit money
Withdraw money
Display account information
